## Project Scope

The application is a restaurants' web page, intended to be used by both customers and staff of the restaurant.

After entering the page a user can browse the menus for different days.

User can click the register button to create an account and log in.

Once logged in, the user can add items to the shopping cart and choose 'checkout' to finalize the purchase.

The logged in user can also set and manage their profile picture, update contact information, view their ordery history and delete their account.

The staff of the restaurant will be granted the admin role, with access to additional features:

- Manage table reservations
- Add and remove burgers
- Add menus to different dates
- Manage pending orders
- Post special offers that will be displayed on the main page

This restaurant web page is a versatile platform benefiting both customers and staff alike.
For customers, it offers easy menu browsing, registration, ordering with a shopping cart, and insights into past orders.
Staff members enjoy administrative privileges, enabling them to manage table reservations, update menus, handle pending orders efficiently, and promote special offers.
Together these features enhance the experience for customers while optimizing operations for the restaurant, making it a valuable tool for both parties.

## Testing the application

After the installation you can test the functionality of the application by registering an user or logging in if you already have a user.

In the profile page you can view or change your information, update your avatar or go back to the main page.

On the main page you can try adding items into your shopping cart and ordering them. Try checking out the menu for different days if you'd like.
